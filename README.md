# PETE_synthesis_project
Green Production of Terephthalic Acid for the Synthesis of PETE

This is the final project for Chemical Engineering class CHBE431 at UIUC. 
• A full scale industrial level manufacturing process from isobutanol to polyethylene terephthalate.
• Targeting using biomass instead fossil fuel for producing polyethylene terephthalate.
